Diabetes Prediction Using SVM-

This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained and tested on a medical dataset containing information relevant to diabetes diagnosis.

Dataset :   
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant    
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test  
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)  
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)    
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)   
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function              
Age: Age of the patient (years)  
Outcome: Whether the person is diabetic or not (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic)

The dataset is typically loaded from sources like the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.  

Training Process:  
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (typically 80% training, 20% testing). The model is then trained on the training set and evaluated on both sets to measure its performance.

Conclusion:  
The SVM model shows promising results in predicting whether a person is diabetic based on medical features. Tuning the hyperparameters further may improve accuracy and generalization performance.
